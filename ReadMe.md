     GODMODE prx for PS4

## Since requested here it is:
     Used eversions trick of fw version resolving on kernel level
     to build a dynamically resolved Prison break and most
     importend patches prx.
     Currently FW's 4.55, 5.01 and 5.05 are supported.
     
     Run "Kamehameha();" once at startup of your userland app code.
     
     Credits to eversion for his fw version resolving trick.
     Special thx to XDPX for pointing my nose onto.
